/* 
Based on the EDA, I want to do the following

- id -> food
- remove googleTopic
- value -> number_of_searches
- week_id -> week column and year column

Very good to SELECT before doing the transformation

*/

SELECT
   id AS food,
   value AS number_of_searches,
   week_id[1:4] AS year, --similar to python slicing
   week_id[-2:] AS week
FROM 
    food;

-- create a new table with these transformations
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cleaned_food AS (
    SELECT
        id AS food,
        value AS number_of_searches,
        week_id[1:4] AS year,
        week_id[-2:] AS week
    FROM 
        food
);
