when we are talking about joins, we are working on columns. not rows as we do in set operations!

-inner join: similar to intersect. common columns will be chosen. intersect of columns in table a and b

-left join: A and B - take everything from a and corresponding columns from B

-right join: A and B - take everything from B and corresponding columns from A

-full join: A and B - join everything


-cross join -
